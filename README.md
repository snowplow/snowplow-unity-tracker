# Unity Analytics for Snowplow

[![Release][release-image]] [releases] [![License][license-image]] [license]

## UNRELEASED

## Overview

Add analytics to your Unity games and apps with the **[Snowplow] [snowplow]** event tracker for **[Unity] [unity]**.

With this tracker you can collect event data from your Unity-based applications, games or frameworks.

## Quickstart

### Building

Assuming git, **[Vagrant] [vagrant-install]** and **[VirtualBox] [virtualbox-install]** installed:

```bash
 host$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-unity-tracker.git
 host$ cd snowplow-unity-tracker
 host$ vagrant up && vagrant ssh
guest$ cd /vagrant
```

### Setting up a Test Endpoint

```bash
guest$ mb &
guest$ curl -X POST -d @/vagrant/Resources/imposter.json http://localhost:2525/imposters
```

The test collector to use: `http://localhost:4545`

Now open Mountebank in your browser (on host is fine):
* [http://localhost:2525/imposters/4545](http://localhost:2525/imposters/4545)

### Development

Currently we have only tested developing from within `MonoDevelop-Unity`.  The IDE that is bundled with the Unity installer for Mac OSX.  However the project *should* open with any C# IDE.

To work on the Tracker:

* Open the following file in your IDE of choice: `snowplow-unity-tracker/SnowplowTracker/SnowplowTracker.sln`
* This solution file will open the `SnowplowTracker`, `SnowplowTrackerTests`, `UnityHTTP` and `UnityJSON` libraries in your editor.

Please note that all Unit Tests are written with [NUnit][nunit].

### Running the Snowpong Demo Game

To open the Demo Game simply select the following file solution from Unity, `snowplow-unity-tracker/DemoGame/DemoGame.sln`, you can then build and run it yourself.
Currently the Demo will only play on your desktop as the layout has not been configured for mobile platforms yet.

Tested Platforms:

* Windows
* Mac OSX
* Linux
* iOS (Opens but not playable as of yet)
