## Overview

Add analytics to your Unity games and apps with the **[Snowplow][snowplow]** event tracker for **[Unity][unity]**.

With this tracker you can collect event data from your Unity-based applications, games or frameworks.

## Quick start

### Requirements

* SnowplowTracker requires Unity 2018.1+ and .NET Standard 2.0 Api Compatibility Level.
* SnowplowTracker requires Newtonsoft.Json. This is [bundled with Unity 2020.1+][unity-newtonsoftjson] or [Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity][newtonsoftjson-for-unity] can be used for earlier versions.
* SnowplowTracker supports both Mono and IL2CPP scripting backends.
* SnowplowTracker.Demo and SnowplowTracker.Tests are Unity 2020.3.16f1 (LTS) projects.

### Installation

* Download the `unitypackage` from [GitHub Releases][releases]. Drop into your Unity Editor.
* If Newtonsoft.Json.dll isn't available, install [Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity][newtonsoftjson-for-unity].

## Maintainer Quick start

### Building

Assuming git, **[Vagrant][vagrant-install]** and **[VirtualBox][virtualbox-install]** installed:

```bash
 host$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-unity-tracker.git
 host$ cd snowplow-unity-tracker
```

### Development

To work on the Tracker:

* Open the following file in your IDE of choice (Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac or JetBrains Rider): `snowplow-unity-tracker/SnowplowTracker/SnowplowTracker.sln`
* This solution file will open the `SnowplowTracker` library in your editor.
* Build files will output to bin/Debug or bin/Release depending on your configuration.
* Built DLLs will also be copied on successful builds to the Demo and Test projects Assets folders.

### Setting up a Test Endpoint

```bash
host$ vagrant up && vagrant ssh
guest$ cd /vagrant
guest$ mb &
guest$ curl -X POST -d @/vagrant/Resources/imposter.json http://localhost:2525/imposters
```

The test collector to use: `http://localhost:4545`

Now open Mountebank in your browser (on host is fine):
* **[http://localhost:2525](http://localhost:2525)**

### Testing Framework

Requires: Unity 2018.4.13f1 (LTS)

* Open `snowplow-unity-tracker/SnowplowTracker.Tests` in the Unity Editor
* Build the SnowplowTracker solution (desribed above) if you have made any changes to the Tracker. This will copy the DLLs to Demo and Tests asset folders.
* Ensure the Mountebank Test Collector is up and running (desribed above)
* Open the Test Runner `Window` -> `General` -> `Test Runner` and open `EditMode`
* Click `Run All` to run all tests

Please note that all Unit Tests are written with **[NUnit][nunit]**.

### Running the Snowplow Demo Game

Requires: Unity 2018.4.13f1 (LTS)

To open the Demo Game simply add the following folder within Unity Hub, `snowplow-unity-tracker/SnowplowTracker.Demo`, you can then build and run it yourself.

Tested Platforms:

* Windows
* Mac OSX
* Linux
* iOS
* Android
